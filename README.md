# KidsCode - A Fun Programming Language for Kids

Welcome to **KidsCode**, a beginner-friendly programming language designed to help children from grades 1 to 7 learn basic programming concepts in a fun and interactive way. KidsCode allows kids to control a simple character on a canvas by writing simple commands like `move()` and `turn()`, with the added benefit of dark and light mode toggle for enhanced usability.
