# KidsCode: A Fun and Interactive Programming Language for Kids

Welcome to **KidsCode**, a fun and interactive programming language designed specifically for kids in grades 1 to 7. This project allows young learners to explore the world of programming in a simple, engaging way. By using basic commands like `move()`, `turn()`, and `repeat()`, children can control a visual object on the screen and learn fundamental programming concepts.

## Features

- **Simple Commands**: Commands like `move()`, `turn()`, and `repeat()` make it easy for children to understand how programming works.
- **Interactive Visuals**: A canvas to visualize the movement and actions of the object based on the code entered.
- **Repeat Blocks**: The ability to repeat commands helps children understand loops and repetition in programming.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, colorful design with minimal text to keep kids engaged.

## How It Works

Kids can enter their own commands into the code editor to move an object on the screen. The available commands include:

- **move(n)**: Moves the object forward by `n` steps.
- **turn(degrees)**: Turns the object by the specified number of degrees.
- **repeat(n)**: Repeats a block of code `n` times.

### Example Code:

```plaintext
move(50)
turn(90)
move(30)
repeat(2) {
  move(20)
  turn(45)
}
```
````

In this example, the object moves 50 steps, turns 90 degrees, moves 30 steps, and repeats the block inside `repeat(2)` twice.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start coding.
3. Enter your commands into the `textarea`, then click **Run Code** to see the object move based on your code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KidsCode.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
3. Start coding and have fun learning!

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the interface kid-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic behind the commands and object movement.
